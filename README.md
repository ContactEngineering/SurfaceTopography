SurfaceTopography
=================

*Read and analyze surface topographies with Python.* This code implements basic classes for handling uniform and
nonuniform surface topography data. It contains a rich set of import filters for experimental surface topography data.
Surface topographies can be easily analyzed using standard (rms height, power spectrum, ...) and some special purpose
(autocorrelation function, variable bandwidth analysis, ...) statistical techniques.

Documentation
-------------

This README file contains a brief introduction into the code. The full documentation can be found at https://contactengineering.github.io/SurfaceTopography/.

Installation
------------

Installation is only possible on unix/linux systems and cumbersome on macOSX. 
For a quick start and if your OS is windows, consider running SurfaceTopography via our [Docker container]().

Detailed instruction for the installation are provided in the [documentation](https://contactengineering.github.io/SurfaceTopography/installation.html?highlight=installation).

The most basic configuration of SurfaceTopography installs all requirements autonomously `python3 -m pip install SurfaceTopgography`

Containerized SurfaceTopography
-------------------------------

*ContactEngineering* provides container descriptions at the [ce-container-stack](https://github.com/ContactEngineering/ce-container-stack).

For getting started quickly with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and `SurfaceTopography` in a ready-to-run JupyterLab environment, try

    docker run -p 8888:8888 imteksim/jupyterlab-surfacetopography:latest

Navigate to the JupyterLab server in your browser as instructed by the terminal output and launch a notebook with the `SurfaceTopography` kernel.
