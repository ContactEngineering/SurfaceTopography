def bandwidth(self, unit):
    """
    Computes lower and upper bound of bandwidth, i.e. of the wavelengths or
    length scales occurring on any topography within the container. The lower
    end of the bandwidth is given by the mean of the spacing of the individual
    points on the line scan. The upper bound is given by the overall length of
    the line scan.

    Parameters
    ----------
    self : SurfaceContainer
        Container object containing the underlying data sets.
    unit : str
        Unit for reporting the bandwidths.

    Returns
    -------
    lower_bound : float
        Lower bound of the bandwidth.
    upper_bound : float
        Upper bound of the bandwidth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scale : str
