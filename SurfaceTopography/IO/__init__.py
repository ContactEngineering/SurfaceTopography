def open_topography(fobj, format=None, communicator=None):
    r"""
    Returns a reader object for the file `fobj`. The reader interface mirrors
    the topography interface and can be used to extract meta data (number of
    grid points, physical sizes, etc.) without reading the full topography in
    memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fobj : str or filelike object
        path of the file or filelike object
    format : str, optional
        specify in which format the file should be interpreted
    communicator : mpi4py or NuMPI communicator object
        MPI communicator handling inter-process communication

    Returns
    -------
    Instance of a :class:`SurfaceTopography.IO.Reader.ReaderBase` subclass
    according to the format.

    Examples
    --------
    Simplest read workflow:

    >>> reader = open_topography("filename")
    >>> top = reader.topography()

    The first topography in file is returned, independently of whether
    the file has multiple channels or not.

    You can always check the channels and their metadata with
    `reader.channels()`. This returns a list of dicts containing attributes `name`,
    `physical_sizes`, `nb_grid_pts`, ``unit` and `height_scale_factor:

    >>> reader.channels
    [{'name': 'ZSensor',
      'nb_grid_pts': (256, 256),
      'physical_sizes': (9999.999999999998, 9999.999999999998),
      'unit': 'nm',
      'height_scale_factor': 0.29638271279074097},
     {'name': 'AmplitudeError',
      'nb_grid_pts': (256, 256),
      'physical_sizes': (10.0, 10.0),
      'unit': ('µm', None),
      'height_scale_factor': 0.04577566528320313}]

    Here the channel 'ZSensor' offers a topography with sizes of
    10000 nm in each dimension.

    You can choose it by giving the index 0 to channel
    (you would use `channel=1` for the second):

    >>> top = reader.topography(channel=0)

    The returned topography has the physical sizes found in the file.

    You can also prescribe some attributes when reading the topography:

    >>> top = reader.topography(channel=0, physical_sizes=(10.,10.), info={"unit":"µm"})

    In order to plot the topography with matplotlib, you can use

    >>> plt.pcolormesh(*top.positions_and_heights())

    with origin in the lower left and correct tick labels at x and y axes, or

    >>> plt.imshow(top.heights().T)

    with origin in the upper left (inverted y axis).

    r"""
    Returns a topography object representing the topograpgy in the file `fobj`.
    If there are multiple data channels within this file, the default channel
    is returned. The default channel depends on the file format; see
    documentation of the respective reader on this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fobj : str or filelike object
        path of the file or filelike object
    format : str, optional
        specify in which format the file should be interpreted
    communicator : mpi4py or NuMPI communicator object
        MPI communicator handling inter-process communication
    channel : int
        Number of the channel to load. See also `channels` method.
    physical_sizes : tuple of floats
        Physical size of the topography. It is necessary to specify this
        if no physical size is found in the data file. If there is a
        physical size in the file, then specifying this parameter will raise
        an exception.
    height_scale_factor : float
        Can be used to set height scale factor if not found in the data file.
    info : dict
        This dictionary will be appended to the info dictionary returned
        by the reader.
    periodic: bool
        Wether the SurfaceTopography should be interpreted as one period of a
        periodic surface. This will affect the PSD and autocorrelation
        calculations (windowing)
    subdomain_locations : tuple of ints
        Origin (location) of the subdomain handled by the present MPI process.
    nb_subdomain_grid_pts : tuple of ints
        Number of grid points within the subdomain handled by the present
        MPI process.

    Returns
    -------
    topography : subclass of :obj:`HeightContainer`
        The object containing the actual topography data.

    Raises
    ------
    MetadataAlreadyDefined
        Raised if given arguments for `physical_sizes` or `height_scale_factor`
        although it's already given in the file.
