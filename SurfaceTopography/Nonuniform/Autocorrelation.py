def height_height_autocorrelation(line_scan, distances=None):
    r"""
    Compute the one-dimensional height-height autocorrelation function
    (ACF).

    This function treats the nonuniform line scan as a piece-wise function of
    straight lines between the data points. The ACF is computed exactly for
    this piece-wise linear interpolation of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_scan : :obj:`NonuniformLineScan`
        Container storing the nonuniform line scan.
    r : array_like
        Array containing distances for which to compute the ACF. If no array
        is given, the function will automatically construct an array with
        equally spaced distances. (Default: None)

    (ACF).

    This function treats the nonuniform line scan as a piece-wise function of
    straight lines between the data points. The ACF is computed exactly for
    this piece-wise linear interpolation of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_scan : :obj:`NonuniformLineScan`
        Container storing the nonuniform line scan.
    reliable : bool, optional
        Only return data deemed reliable. (Default: True)
    algorithm : str
        Algorithm to compute autocorrelation.
        * 'fft': Interpolates the nonuniform line scan on a grid and then uses
        the FFT to compute the autocorrelation. Scales O(N log N)
        * 'brute-force': Brute-force computation using between line segements.
        Scale O(N^2 M) where M is the number of distance point.
        (Default: 'fft')
    distances : array_like
        Array containing distances for which to compute the ACF. If no array
        is given, the function will automatically construct an array with
        equally spaced distances. Can be used only if 'brute-force'
        algorithm is used. (Default: None)
    nb_interpolate : int
        Number of grid points to put between closest points on surface. Only
        used for 'fft' algorithm. (Default: 5)
    short_cutoff : function, optional
        Function that determines how the short cutoff for the returned PSD is
        computed. If set to None, the full PSD of the interpolated data is
        returned. If the user passes a function, that function is called with
        an array that contains the distances between the points of the uniform
        line scan. Pass `np.max`, `np.mean` or `np.min` to use the maximum,
        mean or minimum of that distance as the cutoff.
    resampling_method : str, optional
        Method can be None for no resampling (return on the grid of the
        data) 'bin-average' for simple bin averaging and 'gaussian-process'
        for Gaussian process regression.
        (Default: None)
    collocation : {'log', 'quadratic', 'linear', array_like}, optional
        Resampling grid. Specifying 'log' yields collocation points
        equally spaced on a log scale, 'quadratic' yields bins with
        similar number of data points and 'linear' yields linear bins.
        Alternatively, it is possible to explicitly specify the bin edges.
        If bin_edges are explicitly specified, then `rmax` and `nbins` is
        ignored. (Default: 'log')
    nb_points : int, optional
        Number of bins for averaging. Bins are automatically determined if set
        to None. (Default: None)
    nb_points_per_decade : int, optional
        Number of points per decade for log-spaced collocation points.
        (Default: None)
