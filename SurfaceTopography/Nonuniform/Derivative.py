def derivative(self, n, scale_factor=None, distance=None, interpolation='linear', progress_callback=None):
    r"""
    Compute derivative of nonuniform line-scan. Function assumes nonperiodic
    topographies.

    First derivative: Central differences.

    Second derivative: Expand :math:`h(x+\Delta x_+)` and :math:`(x-\Delta x_-)` up to second order in the grid
    spacing :math:`\Delta x_+` and :math:`\Delta x_+`. Then
    :math:`\Delta x_- f(x+\Delta x_+) + \Delta x_+ f(x+\Delta x_-)` yields:

    .. math::

         \frac{d^2h}{dx^2} \approx 2 \frac{\Delta x_-\left[f(x+\Delta x_+)-f(x)\right] + \Delta x_+\left[f(x+\Delta x_-)-f(x)\right]}{\Delta x_+\Delta x_-(\Delta x_++\Delta x_-)}

    Parameters
    ----------
    self : :class:`SurfaceTopography.NonuniformLineScan`
        Object containing height information.
    n : int
        Number of times the derivative is taken.
    scale_factor : int or list of ints or list of tuples of ints, optional
        Scale factors are not supported by nonuniform line scans.
        (Default: None)
    distance : float or list of floats, optional
        Explicit distance scale for computation of the derivative. Note that
        the distance specifies the overall length of the stencil of lowest
        truncation order, not the effective grid spacing used by this stencil.
        The scale factor is then given by distance / (n * px) where n is the
        order of the derivative and px the grid spacing.
        (Default: None)
    interpolation : str, optional
        Only 'linear' interpolation is supported by nonuniform line scans.
        (Default: 'linear')
    progress_callback : func, optional
        Function taking iteration and the total number of iterations as
        arguments for progress reporting. (Default: None)

    Returns
    -------
    derivative : np.ndarray
        Array with derivative values. Length of array is reduced by :math:`n` with
        respect to the input array for the :math:`n`-th derivative.
