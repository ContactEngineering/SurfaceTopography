def derivative(topography, n):
    r"""
    Compute derivative of nonuniform line-scan. Function assumes nonperiodic
    topographies.

    First derivative: Central differences.

    Second derivative: Expand :math:`h(x+\Delta x_+)` and :math:`(x-\Delta x_-)` up to second order in the grid
    spacing :math:`\Delta x_+` and :math:`\Delta x_+`. Then
    :math:`\Delta x_- f(x+\Delta x_+) + \Delta x_+ f(x+\Delta x_-)` yields:

    .. math::

         \frac{d^2h}{dx^2} \approx 2 \frac{\Delta x_-\left[f(x+\Delta x_+)-f(x)\right] + \Delta x_+\left[f(x+\Delta x_-)-f(x)\right]}{\Delta x_+\Delta x_-(\Delta x_++\Delta x_-)}

    Parameters
    ----------
    topography : :class:`SurfaceTopography.NonuniformLineScan`
        Object containing height information.
    n : int
        Number of times the derivative is taken.

    Returns
    -------
    derivative : np.ndarray
        Array with derivative values. Length of array is reduced by :math:`n` with
        respect to the input array for the :math:`n`-th derivative.
