Helper functions to compute trends of surfaces

from SurfaceTopography.HeightContainer import NonuniformLineScanInterface


def polyfit(self, deg):
    r"""
    Compute the detrending plane that, if subtracted, minimizes the rms height
    of the surface. The detrending plane is parameterized as a polynomial:

    .. math::

        p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k

    The values of :math:`a_k` are returned by this function.

    The rms height of the surface is given by (see `rms_height`)

    .. math::

        h_\text{rms}^2 = \frac{1}{3L} \sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \left( h_i^2 + h_{i+1}^2 + h_i h_{i+1} \right) \Delta x_i

    where :math:`N` is the total number of data points. Hence we need to solve the following minimization problem:

    .. math::

        \min_{\{a_k\}} \left\{ \frac{1}{3L} \sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \left[ (h_i - p(x_i))^2 + (h_{i+1} - p(x_{i+1}))^2 + (h_i - p(x_i))(h_{i+1} - p(x_{i+1})) \right] \Delta x_i \right\}

    This gives the system of linear equations (one for each :math:`k`)

    .. math::

        \sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \left( \left[ 2h_i + h_{i+1} \right] x_i^k + \left[ 2h_{i+1} + h_i \right] x_{i+1}^k \right) \Delta x_i = \sum_{l=0}^n a_l \sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \left( 2x_i^{k+l} + 2x_{i+1}^{k+l} + x_i^k x_{i+1}^l + x_{i+1}^k x_i^l \right) \Delta x_i

    Parameters
    ----------
    self : :obj:`NonuniformLineScan`
        SurfaceTopography object containing height information.
    deg : int
        Degree of polynomial :math:`n`.

    Returns
    -------
    a : array
        Array with coefficients :math:`a_k`.
