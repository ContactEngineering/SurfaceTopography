def derivative(topography, n):
    r"""
    Compute derivative of nonuniform line-scan. Function assumes nonperiodic
    topographies.

    First derivative: Central differences.
    Second derivative: Expand :math:`h(x+\Delta x_+)` and :math:`(x-\Delta x_-)` up to second order in the grid
    spacing :math:`\Delta x_+` and :math:`\Delta x_+`. Then
    :math:`\Delta x_- f(x+\Delta x_+) + \Delta x_+ f(x+\Delta x_-)` yields:

    Parameters
    ----------
    topography : SurfaceTopography or UniformLineScan
        SurfaceTopography object containing height information.
    n : int
        Number of times the derivative is taken.

    Returns
    -------
    derivative : array
        Array with derivative values. Length of array is reduced by :math:`n` with
        respect to the input array for the :math:`n`th derivative.
