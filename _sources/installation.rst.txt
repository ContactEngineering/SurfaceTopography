Installation
============

You need Python 3 and FFTW3_ to run SurfaceTopography. All Python dependencies can be installed
automatically by invoking

Direct installation with pip
----------------------------

SurfaceTopography can be installed by invoking

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip  install [--user] SurfaceTopography

Or if you want the latest unreleased version

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip  install [--user] git+https://github.com/ComputationalMechanics/SurfaceTopography.git


The command will install other dependencies including muFFT_, NuMPI_ and
runtests_.

If you want to install all optional dependencies for full functionality:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ContactEngineering/SurfaceTopography/master/requirements.txt
    # I found the url to the requirements files using
    # https://api.github.com/repos/ContactEngineering/SurfaceTopography/contents/requirements.txt
    python3 -m pip install [--user] -r requirements.txt
    rm requirements.txt

Tip: to install FFTW3 and BLAS/LAPACK on ubuntu, you can for example use

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libopenblas-dev


Note: Sometimes muFFT_ will not find the FFTW3 installation you expect.
You can specify the directory where you installed FFTW3_
by setting the environment variable `FFTWDIR` (e.g. to `$USER/.local`).

If muFFT_ is unable to find the NetCDF libraries (the `FileIONetCDF` class
is missing), then set the environment variables `NETCDFDIR` (for serial
compile) or `PNETCDFDIR` (for parallel compiles, to e.g. `$USER/.local`).

Installation from source directory
----------------------------------

If you cloned the repository. You can install the dependencies with

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

in the source directory. SurfaceTopography can be installed by invoking

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip install [--user] .

or

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 setup.py install [--user]

in the source directoy. The command line parameter `--user` is optional and leads to a local installation in the current user's `$HOME/.local` directory.

Installation problems with LAPACK and OpenBLAS
-----------------------------------------------

`bicubic.cpp` is linked with `lapack`, that is already available as a dependency of `numpy`.
If during build, `setup.py` fails to link to one of the lapack implementations
provided by `numpy`, as often experienced on macOS, try providing following environment variables:

.. code-block:: bash

    export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib $LDFLAGS"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openblas/include $CPPFLAGS"
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"

    export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib $LDFLAGS"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/lapack/include $CPPFLAGS"
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"

where the paths have probably to be adapted to your particular installation method.
Here OpenBLAS_ and LAPACK_ was installed via Homebrew_.

Updating SurfaceTopography
--------------------------

If you update SurfaceTopography (whether with pip or `git pull` if you cloned the repository),  you may need to
uninstall `NuMPI`, `muSpectre` and or `runtests`, so that the newest version of them will be installed.
